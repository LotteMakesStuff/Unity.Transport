# Change log

## [0.3.0-preview.6] - 2020-02-24
### New features
### Changes
* Pipelines are now registered by calling `NetworkPipelineStageCollection.RegisterPipelineStage` before creating a `NetworkDriver`. The built-in pipelines do not require explicit registration. The interface for implementing pipelines has been changed to support this.
* NetworkDriver is no longer a generic type. You pass it an interface when creating the `NetworkDriver`, which means you can switch between backends without modifying all usage of the driver. There is a new `NetworkDriver.Create` which creates a driver with the default `NetworkInterface`. It is also possible to create a `new NetworkDriver` by passing a `NetworkInterface` instance as the first argument.
* `NetworkDriver.Send` is replaced by `BeginSend` and `EndSend`. This allows us to do less data copying when sending messages. The interface for implementing new netowrk interfaces has been changed to support this.
* `DataStreamReader` and `DataStreamWriter` no longer owns any memory. They are just reading/writing the data of a `NativeArray<byte>`.
* `DataStreamWriter` has explicit types for all Write methods.
* `DataStreamReader.Context` has been removed.
* Error handling for `DataStreamWriter` has been improved, on failure it returns false and sets `DataStreamWriter.HasFailedWrites` to true. `DataStreamReader` returns a default value and sets `DataStreamReader.HasFailedReads` to true. `DataStreamReader` will throw an excpetion instead of returning a default value in the editor.
* IPCManager is no longer public, it is still possible to create a `NetworkDriver` with a `IPCNetworkInterface`.
* Added `NetworkDriver.ScheduleFlushSend` which must be called to guarantee that messages are send before next call to `NetworkDriver.ScheduleUpdate`.
* Added `NetworkDriver.LastUpdateTime` to get the update time the `NetworkDriver` used for the most recent update.
* Removed the IPC address family, use a IPv4 localhost address instead.

### Fixes
* Fixed a memory overflow in the reliability pipeline.
* Made the soaker report locale independent.

### Upgrade guide
Creation and type of `NetworkDriver` has changed, use `NetworkDriver.Create` or pass an instance of a `NetworkInterface` to the `NetworkDriver` constructor.

`NetworkDriver.Send` has been replaced by a pair of `NetworkDriver.BeginSend` and `NetworkDriver.EndSend`. Calling `BeginSend` will return a `DataStreamWriter` to which you write the data. The `DataStreamWriter` is then passed to `EndSend`.

All write calls in `DataStreamWriter` need an explicit type, for example `Write(0)` should be replaced by `WriteInt(0)`.

`DataStreamWriter` no longer shares current position between copies, if you call a method which writes you must pass it by ref for the modifications to apply.

`DataStreamWriter` no longer returns a DeferedWriter, you need to take a copy of the writer at the point you want to make modifications and use the copy to overwrite data later.

`DataStreamWriter` is no longer disposable. If you use the allocating constructor you need to use `Allocator.Temp`, if you pass a `NativeArray<byte>` to the constructor the `NativeArray` owns the memory.

`DataStreamReader.Context` no longer exists, you need to pass the `DataStreamReader` itself by ref if you read in a different function.

The interface for network pipelines has been changed.

The interface for network interfaces has been changed.

## [0.2.3-preview.0] - 2019-12-12
### New features
### Changes
* Added reading and write methods for NativeString64 to DataStream.

### Fixes
### Upgrade guide

## [0.2.2-preview.2] - 2019-12-05
### New features
### Changes
* Added a stress test for parallel sending of data.
* Upgraded collections to 0.3.0.

### Fixes
* Fixed a race condition in IPCNetworkInterface.
* Changed NetworkEventQueue to use UnsafeList to get some type safety.
* Fixed an out-of-bounds access in the reliable sequenced pipeline.
* Fixed spelling and broken links in the documentation.

### Upgrade guide

## [0.2.1-preview.1] - 2019-11-28
### New features
### Changes
### Fixes
* Added missing bindings for Linux and Android

### Upgrade guide

## [0.2.0-preview.4] - 2019-11-26
### New features
### Changes
* Added support for unquantized floats to `DataStream` class.
* Added `NetworkConfigParameter.maxFrameTimeMS` so you to allow longer frame times when debugging to prevent disconnections due to timeout.
* Allow "1.1.1.1:1234" strings when parsing the IP string in the NetworkEndPoint class, it will use the port part when it's present.
* Reliable pipeline now doesn't require parameters passed in (uses default window size of 32)
* Added Read/Write of ulong to `DataStream`.
* Made it possible to get connection state from the parallel NetworkDriver.
* Added `LengthInBits` to the `DataStreamWriter`.

### Fixes
* Do not push data events to disconnected connections. Fixes an error about resetting the queue with pending messages
* Made the endian checks in `DataStream` compatible with latest version of burst.

### Upgrade guide

## [0.1.2-preview.1] - 2019-07-17
### New features
* Added a new *Ping-Multiplay* sample based on the *Ping* sample
    * Created to be the main sample for demonstrating Multiplay compatibility and best practices (SQP usage, IP binding, etc.)
    * Contains both client and server code.  Additional details in readme in `/Assets/Samples/Ping-Multiplay/`.
* **DedicatedServerConfig**: added arguments for `-fps` and `-timeout`
* **NetworkEndPoint**: Added a `TryParse()` method which returns false if parsing fails
    * Note: The `Parse()` method returns a default IP / Endpoint if parsing fails, but a method that could report failure was needed for the Multiplay sample
* **CommandLine**:
    * Added a `HasArgument()` method which returns true if an argument is present
    * Added a `PrintArgsToLog()` method which is a simple way to print launch args to logs
    * Added a `TryUpdateVariableWithArgValue()` method which updates a ref var only if an arg was found and successfully parsed

### Changes
* Deleted existing SQP code and added reference to SQP Package (now in staging)
* Removed SQP server usage from basic *Ping* sample
    * Note: The SQP server was only needed for Multiplay compatibility, so the addition of *Ping-Multiplay* allowed us to remove SQP from *Ping*

### Fixes
* **DedicatedServerConfig**: Vsync is now disabled programmatically if requesting an FPS different from the current screen refresh rate

### Upgrade guide

## [0.1.1-preview.1] - 2019-06-05
### New features
* Moved MatchMaking to a package and supporting code to a separate folder.

### Fixes
* Fixed an issue with the reliable pipeline not resending when completely idle.

### Upgrade guide

## [0.1.0-preview.1] - 2019-04-16
### New features
* Added network pipelines to enable processing of outgoing and incomming packets. The available pipeline stages are `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` for reliable UDP messages and `SimulatorPipelineStage` for emulating network conditions such as high latency and packet loss. See [the pipeline documentation](com.unity.transport/Documentation~/pipelines-usage.md) for more information.
* Added reading and writing of packed signed and unsigned integers to `DataStream`. These new methods use huffman encoding to reduce the size of transfered data for small numbers.

### Changes
* Enable Burst compilation for most jobs
* Made it possible to get the remote endpoint for a connection
* Replacing EndPoint parsing with custom code to avoid having a dependency on System.Net
* Change the ping sample command-line parameters for server to -port and -query_port
* For matchmaking - use an Assignment object containing the ConnectionString, the Roster, and an AssignmentError string instead of just the ConnectionString.

### Fixes
* Fixed an issue with building iOS on Windows
* Fixed inconsistent error handling between platforms when the network buffer is full

### Upgrade guide
Unity 2019.1 is now required.

`BasicNetworkDriver` has been renamed to `GenericNetworkDriver` and a new `UdpNetworkDriver` helper class is also available.

System.Net EndPoints can no longer be used as addresses, use the new NetworkEndpoint struct instead.
